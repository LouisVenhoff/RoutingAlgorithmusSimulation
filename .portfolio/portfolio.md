# üß≠ Interactive Dijkstra Algorithm Visualization with React

## Project type
- Small weekend project

## üìå Introduction
- üîç What is the Dijkstra Algorithm?
    The Dijkstra Algorithm is an method to find the shortest Path through an graph. While navigating through an graph it generates a tree structure to represent the shortest path
    from an start node to an target node.
    An enhancement of the Dijkstra algorithm is the A* algorithm which has much more performance.
    Typical applications where the Dijkstra Algorithm is used includes:
    - Network calculations (Find the shortest path through the internet)
    - GPS Systems (Google Maps, Apple Maps)
    - Controlling NPC's in video games
    - Route planning for autonomous robots and drones
    - Logistic planning

- üí° Project goals
    - Understanding routing algorithms (Dijkstra, A*)
    - Some coding fun :D

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools
- I used react to create this app. Because the project focuses on algorithms i did not used any CSS preprocessors or other design librarys like tailwind or other third party librarys

## üß± Application Structure
- üß© Component structure
    - The main element of these Application is an canvas which is rendered after the website is loaded. When you press the button "Position hinzuf√ºgen (Add Position)" you can click in
    the canvas to add some nodes. 
    After placing the nodes you can connect them to build your graph.
    To connect the nodes you have to click on "Verbindungen Zeichnen (Draw connections) and then click on two nodes to connect them.
    After you build up your graph, you can click on start routing. The algorithm now calculates the best shortest route from the first to the last node you placed.
    Because this project focusses only on routing algorithms, i omit functions like selecting the nodes between the route will be generated and used the first and the last node as start and end node.


## üöÄ Outlook & Ideas for Extension
- üßÆ Adding more algorithms and play around with them
- üó∫Ô∏è Add function for placing an background image so the use can route through the streets
- ‚û°Ô∏è Add function for selecing start and end nodes
- üìà Add animation to show how the algorithm is routing throug the tree

### Implementation of a position
For the position i have created an class which stores following information
```typescript
    private xPosition:number = 0;
    private yPosition:number = 0;
    private connectCount:number = 0;
    private neighbours:Position[] = []; //All neighbours which are connected to the position
    private prePosition:Position | null = null; //The best position to connect to the shortest route to connect to the startig point. Used for calculating the route backward after the algorithm has terminated
    private metricCount:number = 0;
    private visited:boolean = false;
```

### Method for finding all neighbours for a position
```typescript
public getNeighbours(allPos:Position[]):Position[]
    {
        if(this.neighbours.length > 0)
        {
            return this.neighbours;
        }

        let filteredPos:Position[] = []

        for(let i = 0; i < allPos.length; i++)
        {
            if(allPos[i].getPosition().x !== this.getPosition().x && allPos[i].getPosition().y !== this.getPosition().y)
            {
                filteredPos.push(allPos[i]);
            }
            
        }

        this.processNeighbours(filteredPos);
        
        return this.neighbours;

    }
```



### Main Method for the algorithm
```typescript
public startRouting() {
    
    let algoTerminated:boolean = false;
    this.setInitialState();
    console.log("Algo started");

    while(!algoTerminated)
    {
        let tempMinPos:Position| undefined = undefined;
        let tempMinCost:number = Infinity;

        for(let i = 0; i < this.posList.length; i++)
        {
            if(this.posList[i].getCost() < tempMinCost && !this.posList[i].getVisited())
            {
                tempMinCost = this.posList[i].getCost();
                tempMinPos = this.posList[i];
            }
        }

        if(tempMinPos != undefined)
        {
            this.currentPos = tempMinPos;
        }

        this.currentPos.calculateNeighbourDistances();

        let allVisited:boolean = true;

        for(let i = 0; i < this.posList.length; i++)
        {
            if(!this.posList[i].getVisited())
            {
                allVisited = false;
            }
        }
        this.currentPos.setVisited();
        algoTerminated = allVisited;

    }

    console.log(this.targetPos);

    this.resolvePath(this.targetPos);

    this.drawPath();

}
```

### Method for finding the cheapest position
```typescript
private findCheapest(): Position {

    let cheapest: Position = this.notVisited[0];

    for (let i = 0; i < this.notVisited.length; i++) {
        if (cheapest.getCost() > this.notVisited[i].getCost()) {
            cheapest = this.notVisited[i]
        }
    }

    return cheapest;
}
```

### Adding a position to the list of visited positions
```typescript
    private setVisited(pos: Position) {
    console.log(pos.getPosition());
    pos.setVisited();
    this.visited.push(pos);
    let temp: Position[] = []


    this.notVisited.map((element: Position) => {
        if (!this.comparePositions(element, pos)) {
            temp.push(element);
        }
        else {
            console.log("Found!");
        }
    });

    this.notVisited = temp;
}
```
